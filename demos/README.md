# Geometry Blender Demos (Jupyter Notebooks)

To execute the code in the Jupyter Notebooks you will need to install 
the plotly graphing library as follows:

- Anaconda Python: *conda install -c plotly plotly*

In some of the demos we will write rendered images to files, 
for this we will need the *psutil* library. To install this
library type in a terminal:

- Anaconda Python: *conda  install psutil*
